# AI Notes

This repository contains my personal notes on Artificial Intelligence (AI).  I'm exploring various AI concepts, starting from foundational topics like local Large Language Models (LLMs), Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAGs), and vector databases.  The goal is to build a comprehensive understanding of how these components work together.

## Map

This section outlines the key areas covered in my notes.  Each heading will link to a more detailed section.

### [Embeddings](./embedding/readme.md)

Notes on how embeddings work, different embedding models, and their applications in AI.

### [RAG (Retrieval Augmented Generation)](./RAG/readme.md)

Exploration of RAG architecture, including how to combine external knowledge with LLMs for improved performance and accuracy.

### [Vector Database](./vector-database/readme.md)

Details on vector databases, their importance in storing and querying embeddings, and different vector database implementations.

### [Prompting](./prompting/readme.md)

Techniques and best practices for crafting effective prompts for LLMs to achieve desired outputs.
