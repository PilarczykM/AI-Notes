# Machine Learning (ML)

Machine Learning (ML) is a subset of artificial intelligence (AI) that enables systems to learn from data and make predictions or decisions without being explicitly programmed. ML models are trained on datasets to recognize patterns and improve performance over time. It is widely used in various applications, including image recognition, natural language processing, and predictive analytics.

## Playing Card Classifier
[LINK](./card-classification/src/card-model.ipynb)

This project is a Machine Learning-based classifier for playing cards using PyTorch. The model is trained to recognize different card types based on images.

### Features:
- Utilizes PyTorch for model training and inference
- Custom dataset of playing card images
- Image classification using Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs)
