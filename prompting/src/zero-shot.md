# Zero-shot
Zero-shot prompting is a prompt engineering technique where a model is given a task `without any prior examples or context`.

The model relies entirely on its pre-trained knowledge to generate a response. This method is useful when you need quick, general responses without extra training data.

## Examples:
### Question answering:
```bash
Prompt: "Who was the first president of the United States?"
Response: "George Washington."
```
### Text Classification:
```bash
Prompt: "Classify the sentiment of this review: 'The product is amazing and works perfectly!'"
Response: "Positive."
```
### Summarization:
```bash
Prompt: "Summarize this article in one sentence: [Paste article]"
Response: "The article discusses the impact of climate change on global agriculture."
```
